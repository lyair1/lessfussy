## When to Talk to Your Doctor

Contact your pediatrician if your baby:

- Doesn't respond to sounds by 4 months
- Isn't smiling by 4 months
- Doesn't babble by 6 months
- Isn't sitting with support by 9 months
- Doesn't crawl or show interest in moving by 12 months

## Tracking Milestones

Recording your baby's milestones helps you:
- Celebrate achievements
- Notice patterns in development
- Have information ready for doctor visits
- Create lasting memories

Consider using a baby tracking app to log milestones as they happen. It's also a great way to share updates with family members.

## The Bottom Line

Every baby is unique and develops on their own timeline. These milestones are general guidelines to help you know what to look for. Celebrate each new skill your baby masters, and remember that comparison to other babies isn't helpful. If you have concerns about your baby's development, always talk to your pediatrician.
